                            <p>0 down vote favorite Bought a biometrics device and was given a Connection String to connect the logs (from hardware) to the website we're creating. I was told that it's easier to just use MSSQL rather than migrate the tables to MYSQL. I'm trying to do it but I keep getting an error: "Connection failed: could not find driver" I searched through the net what could be the possible reasons amp solutions: -I downloaded SQLSRV32, 40, etc. -Configured php.ini, the following does not have semic. php7.2 and PDO - 'could not find driver' Ask Question 0. first of all: System Ubuntu 16.04 Apache2 PHP 7.2 DB: MYSQL  could not find driver. I am trying for hours. 
Hello! My development to date has mostly been MERN stack but I have a software developer interview with a company this week that uses AMP + Symfony so I am diving into this framework. I'm trying to follow along with Brad Traversy's great video series (Up and running with Symfony) but running into a problem creating a database - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfiKn5c9l84  Right off the bat I should explain we have different configurations - I have Apache, MySQL and PHP installed (Windows. I tried searching on stackoverflow and laravel forums and people suggest that it’s PDO problem and not artisan’s or php’s – I followed those suggestions like adding  extension=pgsql.so extension=pdo_pgsql.so in php.ini  No positive result. It always says PDOException could not find driver. Can someone please help resolving. Hi, I recently noticed this problem but can't find any info on what could be causing it, maybe someone here might have an idea: I started printing keys for mechanical keyboards (cherry mx connector) recently. At the beginning everything was fine or I didn't notice the problem. This is what I'm printing (Thingiverse) (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3315115) Now I can't print those keys on about 1/3 of my print bed, left side (Anycubic i3 Mega, Ultrabase). If I print there, the cross cutout. 
I have tried removing the non-PDO driver, but still not working. I have created a username/password to the server PCNAME\SQLEXPRESS and am able to login using SQL management studio. I have tried with that connectionString, but it does not work still. The user already has access to the db. Could it be that I have the wrong version So I am new to docker and this is the first project I have tried to run using it. I am running into the issue of my php-apache container is not able to connect to my mysql container, but only in the browser. I can do "docker exec -it ltphp container idgt bash", and then run "composer install", and all of the "php bin/console doctrine" commands just fine with no database errors or connection problems. When I try to actually load up the site in my browser I am met with the classic "SQLSTATE\. EDIT: When trying to do php artisan migrate I get a ‘PDOException: could not find driver’. I’m using WAMP and I’m in Win8.1. Using PostgreSQL as database. Hello everyone! I am working a school project. We have to make a web app, using the framework and technos of our choice. We chose to use Laravel. Everything was working fine for 2 weeks, and then I started to get this warning whenever using php command line: PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php/20151012/pdo_sqlite.so' - /usr/lib/php/20151012/pdo_sqlite.so: undefined symbol: sqlite3_column_table_name in Unknown on line 0 This prevents PHP Developers Network  that the driver was not found, so I tried to find out which PDO drivers are installed, and mysql is supposed to be there.  with message. solved : I was using default .env settings which were overriding the settings from database.php. Default db settings in .env are for MySQL. I still need the .env file because of the APP_KEY so my solution was to delete db settings from .env. This works. for now. /solved I'm learning Laravel and I'm trying to use sqlite, but I can't get it to work. I get this error with Laravel: PDOException error could not find driver I'm running the latest Lubuntu. I've uncommented PHP5.1からPDOが最初から入ってる、使ってみようと思ったら動かない エラーが、could not find driver？？？ php.iniで「php_pdo_pgsql.dll」読み込んでなかった。.

I'm inspired by google-interview-university (https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university). I'd like to share my experience and show a roadmap to becoming a low-level programmer because I have found that these skills are not as common as they once were. In addition, many students and beginners Not all PDO drivers return a LOB as a file stream; mysql 5 is one example. Therefore when streaming a mime typed object from the database you cannot use fpassthru. The following is a modified example that works with a mysql database. So I've been reading r/PHP for a couple weeks now and I've been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm for PDO. When we last looked at it, PDO was still in PECL and since then has made its way into the actual PHP library. Ever since taking an initial and dismissive look at PDO, we built a lightweight abstraction class on top of mssql_ functions and it's worked great for us. We're using Linux and compiling PHP against FreeTDS db-lib to access our MS SQL Server. It's been working great for us, except. PDO Exception: Could not find driver . and I uncommented the line containing the pgsql pdo extension in my fpm/php.ini. . you could watch nonstop I am not exactly sure how this started, but I have had 3 WD Blue HDDs fail in a little over a month and I have no idea why.

However, on new PDO(  ), an exception is throw with the reason: could not find driver Can anyone tell me how I can tweak PHP to get PDO/sqlite3 working? Do I need to download something. 
I am trying to access a MS SQL server using Windows Authentication. I found an example and tried to follow that (see code below), but every time I load the page I get exception 'PDOException' with message 'could not find driver' in C:\wamp\www\test.php:34 Stack trace: #0 C:\wamp\www\test.php(34): PDO-gt__construct('sqlsrv:Server=P.', NULL, NULL) #1 {main}" lt?php try { $conn = new PDO( "sqlsrv:Server=SERVERHOSTNAME/DPA1" ); $conn-gtsetAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERR.

Basically what I'm trying to do is get the PHP script to extract info from the Access database and echo them out in PHP but I'm getting this error: Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE IM002 SQLDriverConnect: 0 Microsoft ODBC Driver Manager Data source name not found and no default driver specified' in -file path- on line 26 and PDOException: SQLST.

I am attempting to use PDO with ODBC in place of MySQL. I have added the drivers and DSN to my system, however PHP 5.4.19 is throwing an error that states "Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'could not find driver' blah blah blah" After reading through the PHP PDBC and DB2 Functions (PDO_ODBC ) reference on php.net, as I mistaken in assuming that I have to manually compile a generic ODBC extension before this is going to work? </p>

                            <p> My British Rail Class 37 is now available for download! Grab it here (https://www.train-fever.net/filebase/index.php/Entry/1942-British-Rail-Class-37/)! If you'd like to see it in action, feel free to pop over to my livestream (http://www.twitch.tv/ds_killakanz/profile). Comes with 2 liveries, BR Blue and EWS Maroon. Available here: link (https://www.train-fever.net/filebase/index.php/Entry/1974-British-Rail-Class-47/). In case people would miss it on the train-fever.net site. Someone made a mode to remove that message you get when you either want to remove a whole road to prevent vills to use cars or have to make stupid bypasses if you simply want to remove 1 piece to lay a straight railroad but can't due to collision or whatever reason :) http://www.train-fever.net/index.php/Thread/2230-TFPatchPlus. I pieced together this modification this morning. Copying the file from this archive ( hosted on the German Train Fever community website ( to \Train Fever\res\config\name\en will replace the town names with Dutch ones. There are 4620 different (real) town names included. Make sure you back up the original towns.lua. 
Call me nostalgic right? I was hoping there was an easy way to mod certain equipment so it doesn't disappear in the modern age (steam engines for example). I DL'd the TF-Editor from the TF forums to see if I could mod the files there, but my German is a little rusty! Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thank You. Edit: My long long search has ended. :-) http://www.train-fever.net/filebase/index.php/Entry/13-Timeless-mod/. Hi all, Wanting to have a huge collection of UK trains. A selection of companies would be: -Northern Rail -East Midland Trains -First -Virgin Any links would be great. Thanks. Specifically to round up the new issues introduced or not fix in the Fallout 76: Wild Appalachia Patch – April 09, 2019 (https://bethesda.net/en/article/5hrHjCk5RTycypyr3ub4aQ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-april-9-2019) # Armor / Worn Equipment: #Helmets / Cosmetic Items Issue: Multiple Reports of Cosmetic Items suddenly have a durability Bar and being impossible to repair. (Ticket Submitted on 04-10-2019) Trying to find the original post I saw involving a Fasnacht. I live in Australia. Both of my parents are on Centrelink, and have been since before my birth. I didn’t really know anyone who worked growing up. I didn’t really know anyone who had their shit together outside of my retired grandparents. I lived in a small town where nepotism was running rampant in small businesses, and there wasn’t anyone to teach me to drive, let alone take me to work if I got a job in the nearby bigger town. So I didn’t get any work experience as a teen. I have general. I'm not sure how accurate any of this stuff is as I mostly just googled and paraphrased what I found, but yea here's some old west gunslingers that actually lived and breathed, it's kind of crazy to think about. I included pictures too :D Anyways thanks for reading it if you do, and hopefully it's not too long. amp#x200B; amp#x200B; Bass Reeves amp#x200B; Bass Reeves (https://i.redd.it/0ossbhnzxxh21.jpg) Bass Reeves was black and born a slave, beat up his slave-owner Didn't want to post this because it gets made into an announcement and there are two already highly important announcements that I feel are more important than this given our situation. So I request that the mods remove the announcement banner for this for the time being. With that aside, let's geeeeeetttt riiiiiiigggghht into the neeeeeeeeeeeeews: - UET institute withdraws dress code notification (https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/439096-uet-institute-withdraws-dress-code-notification). # MAME 0.206 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=465) Welcome to 2019 – we’re starting the year with a bang! MAME 0.206 is an absolutely huge update when it comes to new dumps and newly working software, especially when it comes to TV games. As far as we know, MAME is the first V.Smile emulator with working controls and the most compatible, with almost all dumped titles fully playable for one player (the second joystick isn’t working yet). A number of JAKKS Pacific games based on similar technology.

### Race information What? Red Rock Half Marathon When? February 23, 2019 How far? 13.1 miles Where? Las Vegas, NV Website: ( Finish time: 2:31:08 ### Goals Goal Description Completed? ------ ------------- ------------ A Don't die Yes B Under 2:30 No ### Splits Mile Time ------ ------ 1 10:00 2 11:51 3 13:19. First of all /u/Pollguard has asked me to take over this thread. And last years was made by /u/root_su and since he is not here. I am making this post. Happy Diwali Guys! In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2019. You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric. Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power. </p>
